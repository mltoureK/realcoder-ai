# ✨ Community Reviewed Badge Guide

## 🎨 Visual Design

### **Prominent Badge (Above Question Text)**

The badge appears **ABOVE** the question text with this styling:

```

│  ✨ Community Reviewed Question              │  ← Green gradient badge
│     with checkmark icon                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

What does this function do?                      ← Question text
```

**Styling:**
- ✅ Green gradient background (`from-green-100 to-emerald-100`)
- ✅ Green border (`border-green-300`)
- ✅ Checkmark icon (SVG)
- ✅ Sparkle emoji ✨
- ✅ Bold text
- ✅ Shadow for depth
- ✅ Rounded corners
- ✅ Dark mode support

## 🧪 How to Test

### **Step 1: Verify Console Logs**

When you select a repo and click "Generate Quiz", look for:

```
🔍 Checking for cached questions for: https://github.com/facebook/react
📦 Found 5 cached questions for https://github.com/facebook/react
📋 First cached question: { id: "q-123", type: "true-false", question: "..." }
🔄 Using 5 cached questions + generating 10 new ones
✨ Cached questions to use: [
  { id: "q-123", type: "true-false", isCached: true, question: "The function..." },
  { id: "q-456", type: "select-all", isCached: true, question: "Which..." }
]
```

### **Step 2: Verify Badge in UI**

Look for the badge in the quiz interface:
- Should appear ABOVE the question text
- Green gradient background
- Checkmark icon + sparkle emoji
- "Community Reviewed Question" text

### **Step 3: Verify Question Order**

First questions should be cached:
- Open browser console
- Look for this log:
  ```
  ✅ Final quiz composition: {
    total: 15,
    cached: 5,
    new: 10,
    order: [
      "Q1: CACHED",
      "Q2: CACHED",
      "Q3: CACHED",
      "Q4: CACHED",
      "Q5: CACHED",
      "Q6: NEW",
      "Q7: NEW",
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: No Badge Appears**

**Check 1:** Console logs
```javascript
// Should see:
📦 Found X cached questions

// If you see:
📦 Found 0 cached questions
// Then no questions were upvoted yet
```

**Check 2:** Firebase
- Go to Firebase Console → `questions` collection
- Filter by `repoUrl == "https://github.com/facebook/react"`
- Check if any documents have `upvotes > 0`
- If no documents, you need to upvote some questions first

**Check 3:** Question object
- Open React DevTools
- Find QuizInterface component
- Check `currentQuestion.isCached` property
- Should be `true` for cached questions

### **Issue: Wrong Order (Cached Not First)**

**Check:** Merge logic console log
```javascript
// Should see:
order: ["Q1: CACHED", "Q2: CACHED", "Q3: NEW", ...]
// NOT:
order: ["Q1: NEW", "Q2: CACHED", "Q3: NEW", ...]
```

### **Issue: Badge Styling Broken**

Check if Tailwind CSS classes are working:
- `bg-gradient-to-r` - Gradient background
- `from-green-100` - Start color
- `to-emerald-100` - End color
- `border-2` - Thick border
