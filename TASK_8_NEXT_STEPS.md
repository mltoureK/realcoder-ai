## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Pricing page not loading
**Solution:** Make sure dev server is running: `npm run dev`

### Issue: Upgrade button does nothing
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. Verify Stripe keys in `.env.local`

### Issue: FounderCounter not showing
**Solution:** Check Firebase `founderTier` collection. Ensure `isActive: true`

### Issue: Stripe redirect fails
**Solution:** Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is set correctly
