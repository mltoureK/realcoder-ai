# Question Distribution Update - Summary

## What Changed

### New Files Created

1. **`QUESTION_DISTRIBUTION_CONFIG.md`**
   - Complete documentation for question distribution
   - Examples of different configurations
   - Cost considerations
   - Instructions for customization

2. **`src/lib/question-plugins/question-distribution-config.ts`**
   - Central configuration file for question types
   - Easy-to-modify distribution array
   - Helper functions for validation

3. **`CHANGES_SUMMARY.md`** (this file)
   - Summary of all changes made

### Files Modified

1. **`src/lib/question-plugins/orchestrator.ts`**
   - Now imports and uses question distribution config
   - Implements "never first" logic for Order Sequence
   - Cleaner, more maintainable code

## New Distribution (15 API calls per quiz)

```typescript
5 Function Variant (FV)    - 33% - Deep code understanding
5 Select All (SA)          - 33% - Complex multi-answer
2 Order Sequence (OS)      - 13% - Code step ordering  
2 True/False (TF)          - 13% - Quick comprehension
1 Multiple Choice (MCQ)    - 7%  - Single correct answer
---
15 Total API calls
```

## Key Features

### 1. Easy Configuration
To change question distribution, just edit one array:

```typescript
// In src/lib/question-plugins/question-distribution-config.ts
export const QUESTION_DISTRIBUTION = [
  { type: 'function-variant', count: 5 },  // Change this number
  { type: 'select-all', count: 5 },        // Change this number
  // ... etc
];
```

### 2. Never First Protection
Order Sequence questions are automatically prevented from appearing first:

```typescript
export const NEVER_FIRST_TYPES = ['order-sequence'];
```

The system automatically swaps any "never first" type to a later position if it ends up first after shuffling.

### 3. Validation
The system validates that your distribution adds up correctly and warns you in console if something's wrong.

## How to Test

1. Start your dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Generate a quiz for any GitHub repo

3. Check browser console for logs:
```
ðŸŽ¯ Question Generation Target: 15 questions
ðŸ“Š Generation Budget: 15 API calls (5 FV, 5 SA, 2 OS, 2 TF, 1 MCQ)
ðŸ“‹ See QUESTION_DISTRIBUTION_CONFIG.md to customize distribution
ðŸŽ¯ Scheduled: function-variant call 1/5
ðŸŽ¯ Scheduled: function-variant call 2/5
...
```

4. Verify:
   - First question is NEVER Order Sequence
   - You get the right mix of question types
   - Questions are randomized
